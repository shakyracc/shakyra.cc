                <p>I recently stumbled upon a podcast called <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/all-podcasts">"Manager Tools"</a> and like all newly discovered podcasts, I immediately sorted the episodes from oldest to newest and listened to the second episode (I always skip the first episode). It was actually 1 episode out of a 3-part series discussing the benefits of what Mark and Mike call "the single most effective management tool available today - the weekly One-on-One". Even though this episode was created 10 years ago, I still got a lot of value out of it. Here's what I learned. ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1">One-on-Ones - Part 1 | Manager Tools Podcast Episode</a><br></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"The single most effective thing Manager Tools can recommend to improve the results that you and your team get is to start meeting with them regularly, weekly for a half hour which is what we call a One-on-One"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is a 1-1?</h2>
<p>In order to get the most out of your people, in order to close the gap between where they are and what they're capable of, you have to know each of your team members individually. </p>
<p>Managing all your people the same is a bad idea. Different people require different things from their bosses. Every person who works for you is an individual. It's not hard at all to get to know their individual strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Manager Tools posits that a better relationship with directs will improve results, but how do you create a relationship with them? </p>
<p>If you want to have a better relationship with your directs, you must engage in regular high-quality communication, discussing topics that are important to the direct.</p>
<p>If you're going around saying "hey, how's it going. how's the family", you're not building a relationship. That's you being polite. We as humans don't magically relate to somebody who doesn't spend any time with us and only talks about things that are important to them. </p>
<p>The Manager Tools team tried many approaches to One-on-Ones and failed miserably until they found the right formula. One particular approach which went horribly wrong was having the manager use the first 15 minutes to talk about whatever they wanted to talk about and the direct using the other 15 minutes to do the same. Why was this a disaster? Wellllll, the manager ended up using about 28 minutes and the direct opted out of using their remaining 2 minutes because.... what's the point? They're already thinking "This meeting is not about me".</p>
<p>So, here's the definition of a one-on-one.</p>
<p>A one-on-one is a half-hour, weekly meeting with every one of your directs structured specifically based on the agenda: 10 minutes for them, 10 minutes for you, 10 minutes to talk about the future. They happen every single week, with every single direct, half an hour long, scheduled on your calendar and rarely missed. </p>
<p>One-on-ones exist to create a space for your directs to come to you with things that are of interest/importance to them.</p>
<h2>Dos and don'ts for your 1-1s</h2>
<p>Don't</p>
<ul>
<li>neglect structure </li>
<li>neglect to schedule it in your calendar</li>
<li>fail to focus the meeting on the team member.</li>
<li>lead with "before we start, give me a quick update on project x". </li>
<li>treat the meeting like a staff/team weekly update meeting</li>
<li>violate the fundamental reason the one-on-one exists which is to give a platform to the direct to allow them to communicate to you what's important to them. </li>
<li>put them on your calendar then reschedule every week, turn up late or completely ghost the meeting with a "sorry I missed this" message. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do: </p>
<ul>
<li>give your 1-1s priority when moving things around on your calendar</li>
<li>allow them their full 10 minutes during the 30 minutes or let them run over if you notice they're opening up and enjoying the meeting. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What to expect when you start doing 1-1s</h2>
<p>You start getting fewer questions during the week. People start reserving their questions for their one-on-one time with you. 
People are no longer making up questions to ask you to create a relationship with you. <br></p>
<p>You end up getting more time back for deep work because you aren't getting interrupted during the week. 
So, when do you schedule the one-on-one? </p>
<h2>Scheduling a 1-1</h2>
<p>The structured agenda of the one-on-one makes an enormous difference, but the real value, the most important thing is that they are scheduled. This is more important than having unscheduled one-on-ones every week. </p>
<p>A scheduled one-on-one communicates to your directs that you're always going to have time with them. You're always going to be investing in the relationship. It says, "This is important. You're important". When a 1-1 has a scheduled reoccurrence with no end date, the directs know that they have pride of place.</p>
<p>Not scheduling says "This might be important any given week. You might be important. The time with me might be valuable. I'm not committing to this." It communicates a lack of interest in doing it and a lack of fortitude in willpower. Not scheduling says "This is just another flavor of the month. This will taper off soon. They're not serious about this. I'll wait it off. "</p>
<h2>The importance of sticking to the 1-1</h2>
<p>Every time you try something new, and you discard it in a month because it's hard, pretty soon you'll never get a significant change to happen. Team members will develop callouses to any kind of initiative and you'll lose credibility.</p>
<p>Weekly 1-1s might be hard to do in the beginning, but it makes your job easier and makes you more effective. </p>
<h2>Why monthly 1-1s are a big no-no</h2>
<p>A monthly 1-1 is a non sequitur. You can't create a relationship with a human being by talking to them for 30 minutes once a month. Dedicating 6 hours a year to each of your directs will not help you understand them well. Plus, you'll likely forget what you talked about in the previous meeting. Instead of being a 1-1, it becomes a business meeting. </p>
<h2>Why bi-weekly 1-1s aren't recommended</h2>
<p>We tend to structure our work memory around things we have to do, deadlines we have to make, responses we have to provide, and steps we have to take over the next 3-5 days. Things that are happening 2 weeks from now are put on the back burner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Relationships don't exist outside of your behavior in the relationship. You don't create a relationship and then have it. A relationship isn't something you have. It is an outshoot of the behavior. If you change your behavior in a relationship, the relationship changes. The relationship is not a thing, it is the behaviors within it"</p>
