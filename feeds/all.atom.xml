&lt;p&gt;This hackathon was an incredible learning experience for me. Of the entire tech stack used to build this project, I only had experience in Jira and Github. @3fcc#1923 and I discoverd Zeplin together as a platform to share figma designs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hackathon was an incredible learning experience for me. Of the entire tech stack used to build this project, I only had experience in Jira and Github. @3fcc#1923 and I discoverd Zeplin together as a platform to share figma designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially thought I could tackle the problem with Django, but that flew out the door as soon as it became clear that connecting it to HarperDB was not going to be a beginner friendly task. Weird that I thought this and decided learning 2 stacks (MERN &amp;amp; HERN) was an easier route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with MongoDB as the database because there's simply more documentation out there on it. As a complete noob, I needed all the help I could get. I ended up following a tutorial on a MERN Tinder clone by Code with Ania Kubów on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q70IMS-Qnjk"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. It's 5 hours long, but it's safe to say I've cycled through it at least 7 times. Again. noob. Totally worth it though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what Ania was saying, I read the Javascript, React and Nodejs(piece of it at least) handbooks by Flavio Copes @flaviocopes. 10/10 Highly recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I went back to the code and tried my best to understand each line, making modifications where necessary. Once I managed to turn the tinder clone into DevHire using MongoDB, I read up on HarperDB documentation. Oh...this last paragraph all happened today [2022-08-29-04-00] btw. I say that because I often allow myself to forget my hard work. Not today though. Today I really pushed to meet the Hackathon requirements and I feel really proud of what myself and @3fcc#1923 have produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, I got familiar with HarperDB through videos and documentation then gave it a try. &lt;em&gt;queue emotional damage.&lt;/em&gt; It's simpler than MongoDB in a way I guess, but the lack of community and documentation makes it a HEADACHEEE. omg debugging was a nightmare, but now that I've done it, I feel like I can do it again with less distress. and what's up with the arrays? i couldn't figure out how to 1. query an array and 2. do conditional search on the entire db, not just a row or hashed value. [2022-08-30-02-14]: i think i might have figure this out now. i just needed sleep and revisited articles. &lt;a href="https://blog.francescociulla.com/crud-rest-api-using-nodejs-express-harperdb-docker"&gt;this article by Francesco Ciulla&lt;/a&gt; clarified things for me. Which means I might be able to make some improvements to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;[2022-08-30-02-14] Deploying the site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Another thing I thought would take no time. 6hours later, here we are. 😪 but I've done it 😁 making use of Heroku's free tier while it's still available. Anyway, here's what it took. 
- googled "how to deploy harperdb app". no results so...
- googled "deploy mern stack". 
- read through a bunch of articles until i landed on one i thought might work for me. i've learned my lesson. don't jump into the first article you find. read them through lest you find yourself screwing up your code and debugging for days. &lt;a href="https://dev.to/stlnick/how-to-deploy-a-full-stack-mern-app-with-heroku-netlify-ncb"&gt;this article by Nick Ray&lt;/a&gt; provided a great guide
- debug debug debug debug. if you check the commit history of this repo, you'll see that it was the node_modules, bcrypt and react-country dropdown packages giving the most trouble. i had to git -rm -r --cache . everything. i probably didn't have to do that actually, now that i know how this all works a bit more. i installed packages in the wrong directories. things were all over the place. thank you stackoverflow for existing 🙏
- more debugging: fixing netlify compile issues when deploying with the help of &lt;a href="https://dev.to/yuridevat/2-ways-to-overcome-deployment-problems-with-react-on-netlify-4l5p#chapter-3"&gt;this article by Julia Undeutsch&lt;/a&gt;
- fixed page not found error with the help of &lt;a href="https://dev.to/rajeshroyal/page-not-found-error-on-netlify-reactjs-react-router-solved-43oa"&gt;this article by Rajesh Royal&lt;/a&gt;
- success ! 🥳 I think I might actually understand how an API really works now. nice 🤗 i think it's so cool that the app is deployed on two platforms. Netflify frontend and Heroku backend. didn't know that was possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tech Stack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backend: 🟪 Heroku, 🐶 HarperDB, 🍃 MongoDB 🔗 Node.js, 🧩 Express, 🟣 Insomnia &lt;br&gt;
Frontend: 🔷 Netlify, ⚛️ React.js, 🎨 Figma, 🎈 Zeplin &lt;br&gt;
Project Management: 🔷 Jira Software, 🔷 Confluence, 🚥 Google Meet, 📦 Github &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew about 🟣  Insomnia at the start of the project. I would have saved soooo much time on backend work. I only discovered it today [2022-08-28]. Game changer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Team Work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met @3fcc#1923 on reddit a few months ago when they were searching for a Dart programming language learning mate. Soon after that I stopped learning Dart and started learning Python. So we didn't speak for a while, until I stumbled upon this hackathon. I approached them to collaborate with me and to my delight they said yes 💃. They live 5 hours ahead of me, but we managed to make this work almost seamlessly. It was a pleasure working with a fellow knowledge hungry beginner to web development. We used Jira, Confluence, Zeplin, Whatsapp and Google Meet to stay connected. We pitched ideas back and forth and gave words of encouragement along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to get side tracked with cool ideas. "oh let me just add this function really quickly" turns into 5 hours of coding EASILY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS is a time sink. don't get caught there for too long. tell a friend you're diving in so they can reinforce a time limit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a designer makes life WAYYYYYY easier as a full stack dev. Thank you @3fcc#1923 for taking on this challenge with me. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVP MVP MVP MVP. I eliminated a block of code every time I sat down with the laptop. Too many bugs? can it. this is a prototype. I kept thinking, " there are gonna be so many experts in this competition, i NEEED working code and cool features to stand out"............garbage. Focus on your MVP. Refine the MVP if necessary. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good project management tools help A LOT. They make remote team collaboration seemless. &lt;/li&gt;

It was actually 1 episode out of a 3-part series discussing the benefits of what Mark and Mike call "the single most effective management tool available today - the weekly One-on-One". Even though this episode was created 10 years ago, I still got a lot of value out of it. Here's what I learned. ​​​​​​​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1"&gt;One-on-Ones - Part 1 | Manager Tools Podcast Episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The single most effective thing Manager Tools can recommend to improve the results that you and your team get is to start meeting with them regularly, weekly for a half hour which is what we call a One-on-One"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a 1-1?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get the most out of your people, in order to close the gap between where they are and what they're capable of, you have to know each of your team members individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing all your people the same is a bad idea. Different people require different things from their bosses. Every person who works for you is an individual. It's not hard at all to get to know their individual strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manager Tools posits that a better relationship with directs will improve results, but how do you create a relationship with them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a better relationship with your directs, you must engage in regular high-quality communication, discussing topics that are important to the direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going around saying "hey, how's it going. how's the family", you're not building a relationship. That's you being polite. We as humans don't magically relate to somebody who doesn't spend any time with us and only talks about things that are important to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manager Tools team tried many approaches to One-on-Ones and failed miserably until they found the right formula. One particular approach which went horribly wrong was having the manager use the first 15 minutes to talk about whatever they wanted to talk about and the direct using the other 15 minutes to do the same. Why was this a disaster? Wellllll, the manager ended up using about 28 minutes and the direct opted out of using their remaining 2 minutes because.... what's the point? They're already thinking "This meeting is not about me".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's the definition of a one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-on-one is a half-hour, weekly meeting with every one of your directs structured specifically based on the agenda: 10 minutes for them, 10 minutes for you, 10 minutes to talk about the future. They happen every single week, with every single direct, half an hour long, scheduled on your calendar and rarely missed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-on-ones exist to create a space for your directs to come to you with things that are of interest/importance to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dos and don'ts for your 1-1s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neglect structure &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neglect to schedule it in your calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fail to focus the meeting on the team member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead with "before we start, give me a quick update on project x". &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treat the meeting like a staff/team weekly update meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;violate the fundamental reason the one-on-one exists which is to give a platform to the direct to allow them to communicate to you what's important to them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put them on your calendar then reschedule every week, turn up late or completely ghost the meeting with a "sorry I missed this" message. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give your 1-1s priority when moving things around on your calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow them their full 10 minutes during the 30 minutes or let them run over if you notice they're opening up and enjoying the meeting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to expect when you start doing 1-1s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start getting fewer questions during the week. People start reserving their questions for their one-on-one time with you. 
People are no longer making up questions to ask you to create a relationship with you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You end up getting more time back for deep work because you aren't getting interrupted during the week. 
So, when do you schedule the one-on-one? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scheduling a 1-1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structured agenda of the one-on-one makes an enormous difference, but the real value, the most important thing is that they are scheduled. This is more important than having unscheduled one-on-ones every week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scheduled one-on-one communicates to your directs that you're always going to have time with them. You're always going to be investing in the relationship. It says, "This is important. You're important". When a 1-1 has a scheduled reoccurrence with no end date, the directs know that they have pride of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not scheduling says "This might be important any given week. You might be important. The time with me might be valuable. I'm not committing to this." It communicates a lack of interest in doing it and a lack of fortitude in willpower. Not scheduling says "This is just another flavor of the month. This will taper off soon. They're not serious about this. I'll wait it off. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of sticking to the 1-1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you try something new, and you discard it in a month because it's hard, pretty soon you'll never get a significant change to happen. Team members will develop callouses to any kind of initiative and you'll lose credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekly 1-1s might be hard to do in the beginning, but it makes your job easier and makes you more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why monthly 1-1s are a big no-no&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monthly 1-1 is a non sequitur. You can't create a relationship with a human being by talking to them for 30 minutes once a month. Dedicating 6 hours a year to each of your directs will not help you understand them well. Plus, you'll likely forget what you talked about in the previous meeting. Instead of being a 1-1, it becomes a business meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why bi-weekly 1-1s aren't recommended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to structure our work memory around things we have to do, deadlines we have to make, responses we have to provide, and steps we have to take over the next 3-5 days. Things that are happening 2 weeks from now are put on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Relationships don't exist outside of your behavior in the relationship. You don't create a relationship and then have it. A relationship isn't something you have. It is an outshoot of the behavior. If you change your behavior in a relationship, the relationship changes. The relationship is not a thing, it is the behaviors within it"&lt;/p&gt;

It took way longer than i expected and the 48 hours mentioned do not include time spent reading django documentation in preparation for this weekend's coding session. It's fair to say that i'm exhausted but i think it was worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again my main trouble was finding reliable and correct guides on how to execute the project. I attempted to reduce debugging time by spending a week reading documentation and troubleshooting problems i figured i might encounter based on my experience with pelican. lol. el-oh-el. i'm not gonna say it was a complete waste of time, but jumping into it head first would have been better. i spent way too much time reading and "requirements gathering" when i should have been building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;django's not bad at all now that i understand it a bit more. i think my biggest limitation is being afraid of concepts and terms i'm unfamiliar with. just go for it dude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and shoutout to my friends who joined my first "live stream" hosted on, you guessed it, Zoom! I wanted a low friction way to document my thoughts as i built the project. constantly switching over to notion to add notes was taking way too much time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that reminds me! i NEEEEED to find a more efficient way to work with html and css. i NEEEED the live refresh. i'm not exhagerating when i say that 30% of my time was spent on css and html today. ai meu deus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barriers to entry when updating the blog: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it takes time&lt;/strong&gt;. i usually think “i’ll get to it later” but then obviously later comes and we’ve completely forgotten what it is we wanted to share. the whole point of this thing is to share a snapshot of thoughts …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;2022-07-24-07-05&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barriers to entry when updating the blog: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it takes time&lt;/strong&gt;. i usually think “i’ll get to it later” but then obviously later comes and we’ve completely forgotten what it is we wanted to share. the whole point of this thing is to share a snapshot of thoughts, ideas and learnings. i’ve learned SOOOO many valuable lessons over the past 4 years and i want nothing more than to share them. on my own walk through life i’ve found it really hard to find resources that teach what i’ve learned, which made growing a lot more painful that it needed to be. …… SO, getting to it later is a ridiculous plan. that mindset is a barrier worth mentioning and holding myself accountable for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i’m never really sure if updating &lt;strong&gt;github pages&lt;/strong&gt; will take 5 minutes or a day. i still don’t understand how much space to reserve for this process and the thought of slaving over the issue for more than 1 minutes turns me away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thinking about the &lt;strong&gt;audience&lt;/strong&gt; kills the vibe immediately. i’ve found myself struck with ‘small island brain’ (or maybe ‘small town brain’?). This has to be a thing right? Where instead of thinking globally we think only of the people nearest us? Whenever I think about writting something, unfortunately i immediately think “what will jack and jill from down the road think?”. Which, when you examine it, is absolutely insane! Because why care about the opinions of individuals you wouldn’t take advice from?????? Gosh, I can’t wait to get over that mind hump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;perfectionism&lt;/strong&gt;. a classic. wanting to write the perfect blog post. feeling like i’m unable to express myself in a clear and concise way. &lt;em&gt;i just had a thought.&lt;/em&gt; lol if no one is gonna read this blog anyway, why should it matter how it’s written. so what if it’s littered with scattered thoughts, run on sentences, grammatical errors…etc. the whole point of this thing is to share! the whole point of this thing is to toss the things i’m learning out into the ether in hopes of someone else finding it valuable some day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;listing these barriers out was a good exercise because i now see that only one of them is valid. the github pages issue can be fixed. it’ll take time, BUT it’s possible. and we’ll no doubt learn something from the solution and be able to share it here. boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this morning i shared a #morningthought in the hikes &amp;amp; friendship whatsapp group. it said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t ever stop yourself from trying something in fear of what people on this island will think.
There is a HUGE world out there and someone, somewhere appreciates your efforts.
Don’t let the bubble limit you. What you can do in this life is infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, let’s update this thing. seems like i’ve forgotten some of the terminal commands. let’s list them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ to activate the virtualenv, navigate to the virtualenv directory using &lt;code&gt;cd virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; and enter &lt;code&gt;source /bin/activate&lt;/code&gt;. i definitely had to hit the up arrow in terminal to get the entry history (i’m sure there’s a more technical way of saying that, bleh) to find that command. seems like terminal recalls the commands you’ve made in specific directories. cool… also, i know. i shouldn’t be using virtualenv with python3 but i didn’t know that at the time i created it. i should be using venv instead)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ okay now i find the directory storing the blog posts, use &lt;code&gt;touch filename.md&lt;/code&gt; to create a new markdown file and (i had to google this one) use &lt;code&gt;open filename.md&lt;/code&gt; to open the file. honestly why didn’t i try that before going to google? #unimpressed '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file opens in Xcode which is currently my favourite markdown editor. to be fair i’ve only used Xcode and VS Code for this, but Xcode feels more lightweight. VS Code feels like a commitment…does that make sense? but perhaps i should get used to vscode because of the integrated terminal…. hmmm. that’s a good selling point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay just tried to run &lt;code&gt;code —version&lt;/code&gt; in terminal and go this back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-bash: code: command not found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ugh, now we’re getting into PATH stuff. i hate it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;found explanation here: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46343212/19118606"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/46343212/19118606&lt;/a&gt; only took 1 minute to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code —version&lt;/code&gt; now returns 1.69.0 ! Yay, that wasn’t painful at all actually. brilliant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay where was i? yes, open the file in vscode using &lt;code&gt;code filename.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;initial thoughts: it’s not so bad… it still feels more cluttered than Xcode but let’s go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ copy and past the post from notion to the markdown file. i’m drafting in notion because it’s my favorite project management/note taking tool for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ now to format the blogpost in markdown. i've forgotten how to do that too so i'm using &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/"&gt;Markdown Guide&lt;/a&gt; to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;google how to add post date and time. i'd like to add this to document how long it takes to get the post online from starting the draft. should also add an automated screen showing time spent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh shit, i just remembered i made plans with my mechanic to work on the xtrail today. darn it. i was planning on building a project with django. ugh. oh well, we'll just learn about CV joints instead. that's fun too. anyway let's rush this post off, add automated timespent screen to the roadmap and be done with this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ use &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one"&gt;Markdown All in One&lt;/a&gt; to preview post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6️⃣ use &lt;code&gt;make html&lt;/code&gt; to ... update the output directory? i think that's what this does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7️⃣ use &lt;code&gt;make serve&lt;/code&gt; to view the website at localhost:8000 in browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8️⃣ use ctrl + C to stop the server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay i admint vscode is so much more efficient, but for some reason the emoji picker doesn't appear when i hit ctrl + cms + space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9️⃣ i've forgotten how to update github pages so i'm using &lt;a href="https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-7.html"&gt;How I Built This Site&lt;/a&gt; to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use &lt;code&gt;git pull origin main&lt;/code&gt; to i guess get the github repo. &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;make html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;make serve&lt;/code&gt; to update the repo i guess. &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;pelican content -s publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt; to create published version of the site &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git commit -m "add barriers-to-entry.md"&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git push origin main&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;ghp-import output&lt;/code&gt; to post contents of the output directory to gh-pages branch &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git push -f origin gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt; to push to gh-pages. this didn't take more than a second surprisingly. awesome. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="shakyracc"></category><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Creating the Site</title><link href="https://shakyracornelius.github.io/shakyracc/creating-the-site.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>shakyra</name></author><id>tag:shakyracornelius.github.io,2022-07-03:/shakyracc/creating-the-site.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It took me 24 long, frustrating hours to create this site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;finding a reliable guide on how to do any of this. I had 0 knowledge of how to make this happen 24 hours ago. Thank you to &lt;a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="https://www.archerimagine.com/articles/pelican/cost-effective-blogging-with-Pelican-and-Github.html"&gt;Archer Image&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href="https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-1.html"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; for their well written articles. It's my fault I couldn't follow them very well haha. I made soooooo many mistakes to get here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;installing pelican and the relevant packages. Reading the pelican documentation (some of it at least)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding a theme! omg the pelican themes SUCK, but I finally landed on &lt;a href="https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/"&gt;Cyborg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying to understand the file structure. soooo much sudo rm -rf &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning a bit of git / setting up github (I'm 100% sure I've only scratched the surface and the thought of that simultaneously motivates me and makes me wanna smash this computer with a cricket bat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bloody terminal. ughh a typical worflow in Terminal goes like this (for me, a noob) 1. confidently enter command 2. spend 1 hour fixing error message. 3. repeat indifinitely &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning Markdown. Thank you &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/"&gt;MarkdownGuide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrading to GitHub pro ($)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and patience. lots and lots of patience. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to properly document all the problem solving involved, but the best I could do was bookmark links to the very helpful answers on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might also be wondering why I chose to create the blog using Pelican. Reason: I'd like to expose myself to Python as much as possible. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh hey, it's my birthday and it's also 2:30am. Great way to kick off 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm beat. &lt;/p&gt;

- - specifies a standard output. often used as synonym for stdin or stdout.
- a lists processes for all users
- x shows processes not attached to a terminal (i.e. not initiated by users through a terminal) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;| grep&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grep with a pipe allows one to search for specific processes. The use of the pipe here is called "piping", which redirects the output of one command to the input of another command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System Overview

    MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017)&lt;br&gt;
    1.8 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5
    8GB 1600 MHz DDR3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setting up MySQL on macOS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm following https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-macos-excerpt/5.7/en/macos-installation-pkg.html &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the disk image (.dmg) file that contains the MySQL package installer &lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select OS Version: macOS12(x86, 64-bit) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Download for DMG Archive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "No thanks, just start my download" when asked to Login Now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the download is complete select the .dmg file to mount the disk image and see its contents. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click the MySQL installer package to open the MySQL package installer wizard. In my case the installer package is named &lt;em&gt;mysql-8.0.29-macos12-x86_64.pkg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
    Select Allow when the security message pops up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the installer wizard is open, &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Continue to start the installation, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue and Agree to the terms and conditions  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install to begin the installation process &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After installation is complete, in the configuration window select "Use Strong Password Encryption".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter a password for the "root" user then select Finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide if you want to keep the installer around. I personally move these files to bin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open System Preferences to find that MySQL is installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open terminal by hitting Command + Space on your keyboard and typing Terminal. Select Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;mysql -u root -p&lt;/code&gt; to start working with MySQL in the terminal. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mysql = an SQL shell with input line editing capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;u = (user_name) the username of the MySQL account to use for connecting to the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-u root = execute the command as the root user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-p = (password) the password of the MySQL account used for connecting to the server&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm following steps from &lt;a href="https://nektony.com/how-to/uninstall-mysql-on-mac"&gt;Asya's&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this to work, we're gonna have to remove all supporting files for MySQL server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications usually store their service file in the Library folder but might sprinkle them around your device. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the Library folder? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A folder that comes with your Mac and is used to store settings, preferences, cache etc... It can be found in the root directory (usually Macintosh HD) &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/reveal-library-folder-in-macos/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1143/mac"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tread carefully, deleting service files can damage your system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Steps to Uninstall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open System Preferences by hitting Command ⌘ + Space on your keyboard then typing System Preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select MySQL (usually located way at the bottom of the window). In the MySQL window, select Uninstall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove MySQL database using the Terminal command line. See steps below. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Terminal by hitting Command ⌘ + Space on your keyboard then typing Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now enter a series of commands to back up and remove the databases. Hit return after each command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To back up data: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check if MySQL processes are working in the background: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shakyracornelius.github.io/shakyracc/ps-ax-grep-mysql.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps -ax | grep mysql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
A result like the following tells us that the only running process is the grep command and no mysql processes are running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;728135 ttys000    0:00.01 grep mysql&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove the msql directory (if required, enter your user password): &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm /usr/local/mysql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sudo = short for "superuser do", allows one to run commands as super user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rm = stands for remove, is used to delete files and directories 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/usr/local/mysql = specifies the directory to remove &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To remove MySQL files (press enter after each command):
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"-r" = (-recursive), recursively deletes everything in a directory  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"-f" = (-force), used to avoid prompts asking if you want to remove the file 1 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Edit /etc/hostconfig and remove the line MYSQLCOM=-YES- &lt;br&gt;
Remove MySQL preferences: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rm -rf ~/Library/PreferencePanes/My*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/*mysql*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart your Mac to ensure all MySQL processes are killed. MySQL should now be uninstalled completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 2016 talk, On Love, philosopher, bestselling author and School of Life cofounder Alain de Botton explores what it actually means to live happily ever after. The warm and witty philosopher of the everyday talks about how romantic myths and misconceptions shape modern relationships, and examines what it might mean to love, to be loved and to stay in love. 
&lt;br&gt;- Sydney Opera House&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a summary of that talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern idea of love comes from the art we consume. We are currently loving within a very historical/social context and living in an era of 
romanticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Romanticism tells us what we should expect from love.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumptions: &lt;br&gt;
1. &lt;strong style="color:#3795BE"&gt;We all have a soulmate&lt;/strong&gt;. Finding them will eliminate loneliness in our lives. We will find them through instinct. this instinct presents itself as a special feeling (the crush). &lt;br&gt;
2. &lt;strong style="color:#3795BE"&gt;Love lasts forever.&lt;/strong&gt; "Till death do us part." &lt;br&gt;
3. No one has jobs and therefore has an infinite amount of time to focus on their love. &lt;br&gt;
4. &lt;strong style="color:#3795BE"&gt;Sex is the crowning expression of love.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the sincerest expression of your feelings. Therefore, any interest outside of the couple will be catastrophic. Adultery is a violation of everything romantics believe that love is. They have put weight on sex that previously wasn't there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Romanticism has been a catastrophe for our capacity to have good, long relationships.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want a chance at succeeding at love we will have to be disloyal to many of the romantic emotions that got us into the relationship in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Areas where romanticism has spelt difficulty for us in relationships:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 1️⃣ It replaced an earlier vision of human nature which stressed how broken we all are.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romanticism insists on the purity and good nature of every human being. For romantics, children are always good. The child is the purest expression of humankind. The only thing that corrupts a child is society. i.e. We are all born good, angelic, perfect people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why is this troubling for relationships?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;It leads to the problematic dynamic which is: self-righteousness&lt;/mark&gt; Assuming anyone is perfect is troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; How do we solve this? &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;By insisting all of us are deeply crazy.&lt;/mark&gt; We all experience some level of trauma that distorts us from childhood. This trauma should be presented as a warning when we enter new relationships.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why are we unable to conceive of ourselves as damaged and crazy therefore prone to self-righteousness? &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;We all have very low levels of self-knowledge.&lt;/mark&gt; After all, the people in our lives have no motivation to shed light on our flaws. So, many of us end up thinking we're easy to live with. &lt;br&gt; &lt;mark style="background-color:#9e8b2e"&gt;SUGGESTION!&lt;/mark&gt; Ask your date "How are you crazy?" and give each other honest, none hysterical answers. &lt;br&gt; ❗We need them to be aware of their imperfections to warn and prepare potential partners. This reduces the chance for resentment to breed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 2️⃣ It emphasizes instinct i.e. the special feeling.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychotherapy tells us the way that we love as adults is a reflection of the way that we learned about love as children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why is this troubling for relationships?  &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;The way that we learned about love as children is likely problematic.&lt;/mark&gt; Our parents may likely have damaged our vision of love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking for a partner we end up wanting to find a familiar love, which is unlikely. If we grew up in unhealthy environments, having a partner who has a secure expression of love will feel foreign and strange to us, which leads to us rejecting secure love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 3️⃣ Its high regard for honesty. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, we all lie very often, which is what society calls of us but somehow we perceive the relationship to be the place where we can finally be our pure, honest selves. We want to find someone who accepts all that we are, where secrets no longer flourish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why is this troubling for relationships? &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;Because after the honeymoon phase has ended we find that ... No we cannot be 100% honest with this person lest we risk them retreating and ultimately losing our chance at love.&lt;/mark&gt; We have to edit in the name of love. This ends up feeling like a betrayal as it directly conflicts with the ideas of romanticism. Romanticism insists on authenticity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 4️⃣ It never talks about the practical sides of life.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eg. laundry; housework, raising children... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why is this troubling for relationships? &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;This sets up the expectation that intelligent, sensitive people don't bother about these types of things. &lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is no preparation and accommodation for the type of difficulties that may come in this area. &lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;There exists an idea that true romantics could never argue over petty household things&lt;/mark&gt; eg. like a dirty towel on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially there is a belief that the practical side of life has no place in a good love life. This is central to romanticism and a disaster for our love life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 5️⃣  You shouldn't talk too much to your lover. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a sign of not understanding them. Having to explain yourself too much invites the idea that there is no chemistry. We want an intuitive understanding of each other without words. In the short term, this is fine, in the long term it is a disaster.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why is this troubling for relationships?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;It leads to an outbreak of sulking. &lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sulk: a feeling of hurt with another person. a wound that the other person has given you that you are not going to explain to them for the simple reason that they're supposed to love you and if they love you they're supposed to know (what the problem is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romanticism tells us that love by its nature is wordless. Unfortunately even the most well-meaning people simply cannot understand all of us. They cannot read minds which goes against the expectations of romanticism.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 6️⃣ It believes to love means to love every single thing about a person, even the imperfections. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of love, the imperfections of a person are part of what makes them so loveable...until. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why is this troubling for relationships?  &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the relationship someone says if you love me, why do you criticize me? Romanticism tells us love and criticism cannot exist in the same space.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; What is a better version of love?  &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Greeks: love is an admiration for the perfect sides of another human being, for the virtues, and qualities. The accomplish­ments in the character and achievements of another person. You may be generous towards their flaws, you may be forgiving of them, but you don't LOVE them. The word love is reserved for admiration for what's virtuous and accomplished in another person. The Greeks believe love should be a process of mutual education in which two people endeavor to become better versions of themselves. They do this not to be cruel or bring each other down, but because they have the sincerest, best interest of each other at heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;❗Love is a process by which a teacher and a pupil are constantly rotating roles. Everyone is the teacher and everyone is the pupil at certain points and has lots of things to take on board. This isn't a sign that love has been abandoned but proof that love is in action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:#9e2e76"&gt; Why are we, such bad teachers? &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many relationship arguments can be seen as failed teaching moments. Note: (1) we don't think it is legitimate to teach. (2) a good teacher is calm and relaxed. doesn't nag or shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there hope for love?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;mark style="background-color:#9e8b2e"&gt;Love is less of a feeling and more of a skill to be learned. &lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What skills do we need to develop?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 1️⃣ Learn to see your partner as a small child from age 2 to 3.5.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with psychological wounds is that we can't see them and so our partners don't give us the accommodation that we need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 2️⃣ Learn to see your partner as a loveable idiot. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color:#2E7D9E"&gt; 3️⃣ Reconcile your habit of getting into crushes. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that every human is problematic from close up and would without difficulty find a way to drive you mad with their mental distortions despite their charm and beautiful skin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;The truth is: there is no right person for us.&lt;/mark&gt; Everybody will be wrong for us in substantial areas. &lt;mark style="background-color:#2F0E24;color:#EFF7FA"&gt;Compatibility is ultimately an achievement of love and shouldn't be its precondition. &lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right person isn't someone who agrees and condones every aspect of our character. ❗It is somebody who negotiates the difference between two people in a particular way with a particular generosity and humor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you know whether you should leave someone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can honestly survey your life, pinpoint all the things that are making you unhappy, and blame it on your partner, then leave. But if your sources of unhappiness cannot be blamed on your partner, then stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When are we ready for love?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you conclusively accept that you are crazy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have a good handle on your partners' craziness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have an absolute awareness that anyone you meet is very imperfect. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you're ready to do the laundry ad discuss towels ad infinitum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you're ready to not insist that others guess what is in your heart but you may even have to use words to spell it out very patiently over long periods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you're ready to believe that all of this with a dose of humor belongs to a sincere relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
