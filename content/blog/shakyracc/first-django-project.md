I spent the last 48 hours working on my first django [project](https://gentle-harbor-06443.herokuapp.com). It took way longer than i expected and the 48 hours mentioned do not include time spent reading django documentation in preparation for this weekend's coding session. It's fair to say that i'm exhausted but i think it was worth it. 

Once again my main trouble was finding reliable and correct guides on how to execute the project. I attempted to reduce debugging time by spending a week reading documentation and troubleshooting problems i figured i might encounter based on my experience with pelican. lol. el-oh-el. i'm not gonna say it was a complete waste of time, but jumping into it head first would have been better. i spent way too much time reading and "requirements gathering" when i should have been building. 

django's not bad at all now that i understand it a bit more. i think my biggest limitation is being afraid of concepts and terms i'm unfamiliar with. just go for it dude.

and shoutout to my friends who joined my first "live stream" hosted on, you guessed it, Zoom! I wanted a low friction way to document my thoughts as i built the project. constantly switching over to notion to add notes was taking way too much time. 

that reminds me! i NEEEEED to find a more efficient way to work with html and css. i NEEEED the live refresh. i'm not exhagerating when i say that 30% of my time was spent on css and html today. ai meu deus.
