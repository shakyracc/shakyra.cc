It took me 24 long, frustrating hours to create this site. 

I know I know... it doesn't look very impressive, but the creation of this site involved:

- registering the domains ($)
- installing python. which apparently isn't so straight forward when your mac comes with python already but that version shouldn't be messed with...risk catastrophic failure blah blah blah. Then there was the confusion with python, python2 and python3... ai meu deus. 
- finding a reliable guide on how to do any of this. I had 0 knowledge of how to make this happen 24 hours ago. Thank you to [Matt](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html) , [Archer Image](https://www.archerimagine.com/articles/pelican/cost-effective-blogging-with-Pelican-and-Github.html) , and [Peter](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-1.html) for their well written articles. It's my fault I couldn't follow them very well haha. I made soooooo many mistakes to get here.
- installing pelican and the relevant packages. Reading the pelican documentation (some of it at least)
- finding a theme! omg the pelican themes SUCK, but I finally landed on [Cyborg](https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/).
- trying to understand the file structure. soooo much sudo rm -rf 
- learning a bit of git / setting up github (I'm 100% sure I've only scratched the surface and the thought of that simultaneously motivates me and makes me wanna smash this computer with a cricket bat)
- the bloody terminal. ughh a typical worflow in Terminal goes like this (for me, a noob) 1. confidently enter command 2. spend 1 hour fixing error message. 3. repeat indifinitely 
- learning Markdown. Thank you [MarkdownGuide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- upgrading to GitHub pro ($)
- and patience. lots and lots of patience. 

I wanted to properly document all the problem solving involved, but the best I could do was bookmark links to the very helpful answers on Stack Overflow.

One might also be wondering why I chose to create the blog using Pelican. Reason: I'd like to expose myself to Python as much as possible. That's it.

Oh hey, it's my birthday and it's also 2:30am. Great way to kick off 25. 

Anyway, I'm beat. 

Until next time,
