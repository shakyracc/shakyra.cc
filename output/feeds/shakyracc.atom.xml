&lt;p&gt;This hackathon was an incredible learning experience for me. Of the entire tech stack used to build this project, I only had experience in Jira and Github. @3fcc#1923 and I discoverd Zeplin together as a platform to share figma designs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hackathon was an incredible learning experience for me. Of the entire tech stack used to build this project, I only had experience in Jira and Github. @3fcc#1923 and I discoverd Zeplin together as a platform to share figma designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially thought I could tackle the problem with Django, but that flew out the door as soon as it became clear that connecting it to HarperDB was not going to be a beginner friendly task. Weird that I thought this and decided learning 2 stacks (MERN &amp;amp; HERN) was an easier route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with MongoDB as the database because there's simply more documentation out there on it. As a complete noob, I needed all the help I could get. I ended up following a tutorial on a MERN Tinder clone by Code with Ania Kubów on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q70IMS-Qnjk"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. It's 5 hours long, but it's safe to say I've cycled through it at least 7 times. Again. noob. Totally worth it though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what Ania was saying, I read the Javascript, React and Nodejs(piece of it at least) handbooks by Flavio Copes @flaviocopes. 10/10 Highly recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I went back to the code and tried my best to understand each line, making modifications where necessary. Once I managed to turn the tinder clone into DevHire using MongoDB, I read up on HarperDB documentation. Oh...this last paragraph all happened today [2022-08-29-04-00] btw. I say that because I often allow myself to forget my hard work. Not today though. Today I really pushed to meet the Hackathon requirements and I feel really proud of what myself and @3fcc#1923 have produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, I got familiar with HarperDB through videos and documentation then gave it a try. &lt;em&gt;queue emotional damage.&lt;/em&gt; It's simpler than MongoDB in a way I guess, but the lack of community and documentation makes it a HEADACHEEE. omg debugging was a nightmare, but now that I've done it, I feel like I can do it again with less distress. and what's up with the arrays? i couldn't figure out how to 1. query an array and 2. do conditional search on the entire db, not just a row or hashed value. [2022-08-30-02-14]: i think i might have figure this out now. i just needed sleep and revisited articles. &lt;a href="https://blog.francescociulla.com/crud-rest-api-using-nodejs-express-harperdb-docker"&gt;this article by Francesco Ciulla&lt;/a&gt; clarified things for me. Which means I might be able to make some improvements to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;[2022-08-30-02-14] Deploying the site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Another thing I thought would take no time. 6hours later, here we are. 😪 but I've done it 😁 making use of Heroku's free tier while it's still available. Anyway, here's what it took. 
- googled "how to deploy harperdb app". no results so...
- googled "deploy mern stack". 
- read through a bunch of articles until i landed on one i thought might work for me. i've learned my lesson. don't jump into the first article you find. read them through lest you find yourself screwing up your code and debugging for days. &lt;a href="https://dev.to/stlnick/how-to-deploy-a-full-stack-mern-app-with-heroku-netlify-ncb"&gt;this article by Nick Ray&lt;/a&gt; provided a great guide
- debug debug debug debug. if you check the commit history of this repo, you'll see that it was the node_modules, bcrypt and react-country dropdown packages giving the most trouble. i had to git -rm -r --cache . everything. i probably didn't have to do that actually, now that i know how this all works a bit more. i installed packages in the wrong directories. things were all over the place. thank you stackoverflow for existing 🙏
- more debugging: fixing netlify compile issues when deploying with the help of &lt;a href="https://dev.to/yuridevat/2-ways-to-overcome-deployment-problems-with-react-on-netlify-4l5p#chapter-3"&gt;this article by Julia Undeutsch&lt;/a&gt;
- fixed page not found error with the help of &lt;a href="https://dev.to/rajeshroyal/page-not-found-error-on-netlify-reactjs-react-router-solved-43oa"&gt;this article by Rajesh Royal&lt;/a&gt;
- success ! 🥳 I think I might actually understand how an API really works now. nice 🤗 i think it's so cool that the app is deployed on two platforms. Netflify frontend and Heroku backend. didn't know that was possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tech Stack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backend: 🟪 Heroku, 🐶 HarperDB, 🍃 MongoDB 🔗 Node.js, 🧩 Express, 🟣 Insomnia &lt;br&gt;
Frontend: 🔷 Netlify, ⚛️ React.js, 🎨 Figma, 🎈 Zeplin &lt;br&gt;
Project Management: 🔷 Jira Software, 🔷 Confluence, 🚥 Google Meet, 📦 Github &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew about 🟣  Insomnia at the start of the project. I would have saved soooo much time on backend work. I only discovered it today [2022-08-28]. Game changer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Team Work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met @3fcc#1923 on reddit a few months ago when they were searching for a Dart programming language learning mate. Soon after that I stopped learning Dart and started learning Python. So we didn't speak for a while, until I stumbled upon this hackathon. I approached them to collaborate with me and to my delight they said yes 💃. They live 5 hours ahead of me, but we managed to make this work almost seamlessly. It was a pleasure working with a fellow knowledge hungry beginner to web development. We used Jira, Confluence, Zeplin, Whatsapp and Google Meet to stay connected. We pitched ideas back and forth and gave words of encouragement along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to get side tracked with cool ideas. "oh let me just add this function really quickly" turns into 5 hours of coding EASILY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS is a time sink. don't get caught there for too long. tell a friend you're diving in so they can reinforce a time limit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a designer makes life WAYYYYYY easier as a full stack dev. Thank you @3fcc#1923 for taking on this challenge with me. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVP MVP MVP MVP. I eliminated a block of code every time I sat down with the laptop. Too many bugs? can it. this is a prototype. I kept thinking, " there are gonna be so many experts in this competition, i NEEED working code and cool features to stand out"............garbage. Focus on your MVP. Refine the MVP if necessary. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good project management tools help A LOT. They make remote team collaboration seemless. &lt;/li&gt;

It was actually 1 episode out of a 3-part series discussing the benefits of what Mark and Mike call "the single most effective management tool available today - the weekly One-on-One". Even though this episode was created 10 years ago, I still got a lot of value out of it. Here's what I learned. ​​​​​​​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1"&gt;One-on-Ones - Part 1 | Manager Tools Podcast Episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The single most effective thing Manager Tools can recommend to improve the results that you and your team get is to start meeting with them regularly, weekly for a half hour which is what we call a One-on-One"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a 1-1?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get the most out of your people, in order to close the gap between where they are and what they're capable of, you have to know each of your team members individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing all your people the same is a bad idea. Different people require different things from their bosses. Every person who works for you is an individual. It's not hard at all to get to know their individual strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manager Tools posits that a better relationship with directs will improve results, but how do you create a relationship with them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a better relationship with your directs, you must engage in regular high-quality communication, discussing topics that are important to the direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going around saying "hey, how's it going. how's the family", you're not building a relationship. That's you being polite. We as humans don't magically relate to somebody who doesn't spend any time with us and only talks about things that are important to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manager Tools team tried many approaches to One-on-Ones and failed miserably until they found the right formula. One particular approach which went horribly wrong was having the manager use the first 15 minutes to talk about whatever they wanted to talk about and the direct using the other 15 minutes to do the same. Why was this a disaster? Wellllll, the manager ended up using about 28 minutes and the direct opted out of using their remaining 2 minutes because.... what's the point? They're already thinking "This meeting is not about me".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's the definition of a one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-on-one is a half-hour, weekly meeting with every one of your directs structured specifically based on the agenda: 10 minutes for them, 10 minutes for you, 10 minutes to talk about the future. They happen every single week, with every single direct, half an hour long, scheduled on your calendar and rarely missed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-on-ones exist to create a space for your directs to come to you with things that are of interest/importance to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dos and don'ts for your 1-1s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neglect structure &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neglect to schedule it in your calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fail to focus the meeting on the team member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead with "before we start, give me a quick update on project x". &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treat the meeting like a staff/team weekly update meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;violate the fundamental reason the one-on-one exists which is to give a platform to the direct to allow them to communicate to you what's important to them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put them on your calendar then reschedule every week, turn up late or completely ghost the meeting with a "sorry I missed this" message. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give your 1-1s priority when moving things around on your calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow them their full 10 minutes during the 30 minutes or let them run over if you notice they're opening up and enjoying the meeting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to expect when you start doing 1-1s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start getting fewer questions during the week. People start reserving their questions for their one-on-one time with you. 
People are no longer making up questions to ask you to create a relationship with you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You end up getting more time back for deep work because you aren't getting interrupted during the week. 
So, when do you schedule the one-on-one? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scheduling a 1-1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structured agenda of the one-on-one makes an enormous difference, but the real value, the most important thing is that they are scheduled. This is more important than having unscheduled one-on-ones every week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scheduled one-on-one communicates to your directs that you're always going to have time with them. You're always going to be investing in the relationship. It says, "This is important. You're important". When a 1-1 has a scheduled reoccurrence with no end date, the directs know that they have pride of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not scheduling says "This might be important any given week. You might be important. The time with me might be valuable. I'm not committing to this." It communicates a lack of interest in doing it and a lack of fortitude in willpower. Not scheduling says "This is just another flavor of the month. This will taper off soon. They're not serious about this. I'll wait it off. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of sticking to the 1-1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you try something new, and you discard it in a month because it's hard, pretty soon you'll never get a significant change to happen. Team members will develop callouses to any kind of initiative and you'll lose credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekly 1-1s might be hard to do in the beginning, but it makes your job easier and makes you more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why monthly 1-1s are a big no-no&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monthly 1-1 is a non sequitur. You can't create a relationship with a human being by talking to them for 30 minutes once a month. Dedicating 6 hours a year to each of your directs will not help you understand them well. Plus, you'll likely forget what you talked about in the previous meeting. Instead of being a 1-1, it becomes a business meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why bi-weekly 1-1s aren't recommended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to structure our work memory around things we have to do, deadlines we have to make, responses we have to provide, and steps we have to take over the next 3-5 days. Things that are happening 2 weeks from now are put on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Relationships don't exist outside of your behavior in the relationship. You don't create a relationship and then have it. A relationship isn't something you have. It is an outshoot of the behavior. If you change your behavior in a relationship, the relationship changes. The relationship is not a thing, it is the behaviors within it"&lt;/p&gt;

It took way longer than i expected and the 48 hours mentioned do not include time spent reading django documentation in preparation for this weekend's coding session. It's fair to say that i'm exhausted but i think it was worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again my main trouble was finding reliable and correct guides on how to execute the project. I attempted to reduce debugging time by spending a week reading documentation and troubleshooting problems i figured i might encounter based on my experience with pelican. lol. el-oh-el. i'm not gonna say it was a complete waste of time, but jumping into it head first would have been better. i spent way too much time reading and "requirements gathering" when i should have been building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;django's not bad at all now that i understand it a bit more. i think my biggest limitation is being afraid of concepts and terms i'm unfamiliar with. just go for it dude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and shoutout to my friends who joined my first "live stream" hosted on, you guessed it, Zoom! I wanted a low friction way to document my thoughts as i built the project. constantly switching over to notion to add notes was taking way too much time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that reminds me! i NEEEEED to find a more efficient way to work with html and css. i NEEEED the live refresh. i'm not exhagerating when i say that 30% of my time was spent on css and html today. ai meu deus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barriers to entry when updating the blog: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it takes time&lt;/strong&gt;. i usually think “i’ll get to it later” but then obviously later comes and we’ve completely forgotten what it is we wanted to share. the whole point of this thing is to share a snapshot of thoughts …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;2022-07-24-07-05&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barriers to entry when updating the blog: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it takes time&lt;/strong&gt;. i usually think “i’ll get to it later” but then obviously later comes and we’ve completely forgotten what it is we wanted to share. the whole point of this thing is to share a snapshot of thoughts, ideas and learnings. i’ve learned SOOOO many valuable lessons over the past 4 years and i want nothing more than to share them. on my own walk through life i’ve found it really hard to find resources that teach what i’ve learned, which made growing a lot more painful that it needed to be. …… SO, getting to it later is a ridiculous plan. that mindset is a barrier worth mentioning and holding myself accountable for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i’m never really sure if updating &lt;strong&gt;github pages&lt;/strong&gt; will take 5 minutes or a day. i still don’t understand how much space to reserve for this process and the thought of slaving over the issue for more than 1 minutes turns me away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thinking about the &lt;strong&gt;audience&lt;/strong&gt; kills the vibe immediately. i’ve found myself struck with ‘small island brain’ (or maybe ‘small town brain’?). This has to be a thing right? Where instead of thinking globally we think only of the people nearest us? Whenever I think about writting something, unfortunately i immediately think “what will jack and jill from down the road think?”. Which, when you examine it, is absolutely insane! Because why care about the opinions of individuals you wouldn’t take advice from?????? Gosh, I can’t wait to get over that mind hump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;perfectionism&lt;/strong&gt;. a classic. wanting to write the perfect blog post. feeling like i’m unable to express myself in a clear and concise way. &lt;em&gt;i just had a thought.&lt;/em&gt; lol if no one is gonna read this blog anyway, why should it matter how it’s written. so what if it’s littered with scattered thoughts, run on sentences, grammatical errors…etc. the whole point of this thing is to share! the whole point of this thing is to toss the things i’m learning out into the ether in hopes of someone else finding it valuable some day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;listing these barriers out was a good exercise because i now see that only one of them is valid. the github pages issue can be fixed. it’ll take time, BUT it’s possible. and we’ll no doubt learn something from the solution and be able to share it here. boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this morning i shared a #morningthought in the hikes &amp;amp; friendship whatsapp group. it said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t ever stop yourself from trying something in fear of what people on this island will think.
There is a HUGE world out there and someone, somewhere appreciates your efforts.
Don’t let the bubble limit you. What you can do in this life is infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, let’s update this thing. seems like i’ve forgotten some of the terminal commands. let’s list them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ to activate the virtualenv, navigate to the virtualenv directory using &lt;code&gt;cd virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; and enter &lt;code&gt;source /bin/activate&lt;/code&gt;. i definitely had to hit the up arrow in terminal to get the entry history (i’m sure there’s a more technical way of saying that, bleh) to find that command. seems like terminal recalls the commands you’ve made in specific directories. cool… also, i know. i shouldn’t be using virtualenv with python3 but i didn’t know that at the time i created it. i should be using venv instead)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ okay now i find the directory storing the blog posts, use &lt;code&gt;touch filename.md&lt;/code&gt; to create a new markdown file and (i had to google this one) use &lt;code&gt;open filename.md&lt;/code&gt; to open the file. honestly why didn’t i try that before going to google? #unimpressed '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file opens in Xcode which is currently my favourite markdown editor. to be fair i’ve only used Xcode and VS Code for this, but Xcode feels more lightweight. VS Code feels like a commitment…does that make sense? but perhaps i should get used to vscode because of the integrated terminal…. hmmm. that’s a good selling point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay just tried to run &lt;code&gt;code —version&lt;/code&gt; in terminal and go this back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-bash: code: command not found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ugh, now we’re getting into PATH stuff. i hate it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;found explanation here: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46343212/19118606"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/46343212/19118606&lt;/a&gt; only took 1 minute to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code —version&lt;/code&gt; now returns 1.69.0 ! Yay, that wasn’t painful at all actually. brilliant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay where was i? yes, open the file in vscode using &lt;code&gt;code filename.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;initial thoughts: it’s not so bad… it still feels more cluttered than Xcode but let’s go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ copy and past the post from notion to the markdown file. i’m drafting in notion because it’s my favorite project management/note taking tool for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ now to format the blogpost in markdown. i've forgotten how to do that too so i'm using &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/"&gt;Markdown Guide&lt;/a&gt; to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;google how to add post date and time. i'd like to add this to document how long it takes to get the post online from starting the draft. should also add an automated screen showing time spent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh shit, i just remembered i made plans with my mechanic to work on the xtrail today. darn it. i was planning on building a project with django. ugh. oh well, we'll just learn about CV joints instead. that's fun too. anyway let's rush this post off, add automated timespent screen to the roadmap and be done with this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ use &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one"&gt;Markdown All in One&lt;/a&gt; to preview post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6️⃣ use &lt;code&gt;make html&lt;/code&gt; to ... update the output directory? i think that's what this does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7️⃣ use &lt;code&gt;make serve&lt;/code&gt; to view the website at localhost:8000 in browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8️⃣ use ctrl + C to stop the server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay i admint vscode is so much more efficient, but for some reason the emoji picker doesn't appear when i hit ctrl + cms + space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9️⃣ i've forgotten how to update github pages so i'm using &lt;a href="https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-7.html"&gt;How I Built This Site&lt;/a&gt; to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use &lt;code&gt;git pull origin main&lt;/code&gt; to i guess get the github repo. &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;make html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;make serve&lt;/code&gt; to update the repo i guess. &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;pelican content -s publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt; to create published version of the site &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git commit -m "add barriers-to-entry.md"&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git push origin main&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;ghp-import output&lt;/code&gt; to post contents of the output directory to gh-pages branch &lt;br&gt;
use &lt;code&gt;git push -f origin gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt; to push to gh-pages. this didn't take more than a second surprisingly. awesome. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="shakyracc"></category><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Creating the Site</title><link href="https://shakyracornelius.github.io/shakyracc/creating-the-site.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>shakyra</name></author><id>tag:shakyracornelius.github.io,2022-07-03:/shakyracc/creating-the-site.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It took me 24 long, frustrating hours to create this site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;finding a reliable guide on how to do any of this. I had 0 knowledge of how to make this happen 24 hours ago. Thank you to &lt;a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="https://www.archerimagine.com/articles/pelican/cost-effective-blogging-with-Pelican-and-Github.html"&gt;Archer Image&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href="https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-1.html"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; for their well written articles. It's my fault I couldn't follow them very well haha. I made soooooo many mistakes to get here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;installing pelican and the relevant packages. Reading the pelican documentation (some of it at least)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding a theme! omg the pelican themes SUCK, but I finally landed on &lt;a href="https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/"&gt;Cyborg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying to understand the file structure. soooo much sudo rm -rf &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning a bit of git / setting up github (I'm 100% sure I've only scratched the surface and the thought of that simultaneously motivates me and makes me wanna smash this computer with a cricket bat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bloody terminal. ughh a typical worflow in Terminal goes like this (for me, a noob) 1. confidently enter command 2. spend 1 hour fixing error message. 3. repeat indifinitely &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning Markdown. Thank you &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/"&gt;MarkdownGuide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrading to GitHub pro ($)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and patience. lots and lots of patience. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to properly document all the problem solving involved, but the best I could do was bookmark links to the very helpful answers on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might also be wondering why I chose to create the blog using Pelican. Reason: I'd like to expose myself to Python as much as possible. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh hey, it's my birthday and it's also 2:30am. Great way to kick off 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm beat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
