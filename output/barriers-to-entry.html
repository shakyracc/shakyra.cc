<p>Barriers to entry when updating the blog: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>it takes time</strong>. i usually think ‚Äúi‚Äôll get to it later‚Äù but then obviously later comes and we‚Äôve completely forgotten what it is we wanted to share. the whole point of this thing is to share a snapshot of thoughts, ideas and learnings. i‚Äôve learned SOOOO many valuable lessons over the past 4 years and i want nothing more than to share them. on my own walk through life i‚Äôve found it really hard to find resources that teach what i‚Äôve learned, which made growing a lot more painful that it needed to be. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ SO, getting to it later is a ridiculous plan. that mindset is a barrier worth mentioning and holding myself accountable for.</li>
<li>i‚Äôm never really sure if updating <strong>github pages</strong> will take 5 minutes or a day. i still don‚Äôt understand how much space to reserve for this process and the thought of slaving over the issue for more than 1 minutes turns me away.</li>
<li>thinking about the <strong>audience</strong> kills the vibe immediately. i‚Äôve found myself struck with ‚Äòsmall island brain‚Äô (or maybe ‚Äòsmall town brain‚Äô?). This has to be a thing right? Where instead of thinking globally we think only of the people nearest us? Whenever I think about writting something, unfortunately i immediately think ‚Äúwhat will jack and jill from down the road think?‚Äù. Which, when you examine it, is absolutely insane! Because why care about the opinions of individuals you wouldn‚Äôt take advice from?????? Gosh, I can‚Äôt wait to get over that mind hump.</li>
<li><strong>perfectionism</strong>. a classic. wanting to write the perfect blog post. feeling like i‚Äôm unable to express myself in a clear and concise way. <em>i just had a thought.</em> lol if no one is gonna read this blog anyway, why should it matter how it‚Äôs written. so what if it‚Äôs littered with scattered thoughts, run on sentences, grammatical errors‚Ä¶etc. the whole point of this thing is to share! the whole point of this thing is to toss the things i‚Äôm learning out into the ether in hopes of someone else finding it valuable some day.</li>
</ul>
<p>listing these barriers out was a good exercise because i now see that only one of them is valid. the github pages issue can be fixed. it‚Äôll take time, BUT it‚Äôs possible. and we‚Äôll no doubt learn something from the solution and be able to share it here. boom.</p>
<p>this morning i shared a #morningthought in the hikes &amp; friendship whatsapp group. it said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don‚Äôt ever stop yourself from trying something in fear of what people on this island will think.
There is a HUGE world out there and someone, somewhere appreciates your efforts.
Don‚Äôt let the bubble limit you. What you can do in this life is infinite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>anyway, let‚Äôs update this thing. seems like i‚Äôve forgotten some of the terminal commands. let‚Äôs list them here.</p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ to activate the virtualenv, navigate to the virtualenv directory using <code>cd virtualenv</code> and enter <code>source /bin/activate</code>. i definitely had to hit the up arrow in terminal to get the entry history (i‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a more technical way of saying that, bleh) to find that command. seems like terminal recalls the commands you‚Äôve made in specific directories. cool‚Ä¶ also, i know. i shouldn‚Äôt be using virtualenv with python3 but i didn‚Äôt know that at the time i created it. i should be using venv instead)</p>
<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ okay now i find the directory storing the blog posts, use <code>touch filename.md</code> to create a new markdown file and (i had to google this one) use <code>open filename.md</code> to open the file. honestly why didn‚Äôt i try that before going to google? #unimpressed '</p>
<p>the file opens in Xcode which is currently my favourite markdown editor. to be fair i‚Äôve only used Xcode and VS Code for this, but Xcode feels more lightweight. VS Code feels like a commitment‚Ä¶does that make sense? but perhaps i should get used to vscode because of the integrated terminal‚Ä¶. hmmm. that‚Äôs a good selling point. </p>
<p>okay just tried to run <code>code ‚Äîversion</code> in terminal and go this back</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-bash: code: command not found</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ugh, now we‚Äôre getting into PATH stuff. i hate it here. </p>
<p>found explanation here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46343212/19118606">https://stackoverflow.com/a/46343212/19118606</a> only took 1 minute to find. </p>
<p><code>code ‚Äîversion</code> now returns 1.69.0 ! Yay, that wasn‚Äôt painful at all actually. brilliant. </p>
<p>okay where was i? yes, open the file in vscode using <code>code filename.md</code>.</p>
<p>initial thoughts: it‚Äôs not so bad‚Ä¶ it still feels more cluttered than Xcode but let‚Äôs go with it. </p>
<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ copy and past the post from notion to the markdown file. i‚Äôm drafting in notion because it‚Äôs my favorite project management/note taking tool for personal projects.</p>
<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ now to format the blogpost in markdown. i've forgotten how to do that too so i'm using <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Markdown Guide</a> to help. </p>
<p>google how to add post date and time. i'd like to add this to document how long it takes to get the post online from starting the draft. should also add an automated screen showing time spent. </p>
<p>oh shit, i just remembered i made plans with my mechanic to work on the xtrail today. darn it. i was planning on building a project with django. ugh. oh well, we'll just learn about CV joints instead. that's fun too. anyway let's rush this post off, add automated timespent screen to the roadmap and be done with this. </p>
<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">Markdown All in One</a> to preview post. </p>
<p>6Ô∏è‚É£ use <code>make html</code> to ... update the output directory? i think that's what this does. </p>
<p>7Ô∏è‚É£ use <code>make serve</code> to view the website at localhost:8000 in browser.</p>
<p>8Ô∏è‚É£ use ctrl + C to stop the server</p>
<p>okay i admint vscode is so much more efficient, but for some reason the emoji picker doesn't appear when i hit ctrl + cms + space.</p>
<p>9Ô∏è‚É£ i've forgotten how to update github pages so i'm using <a href="https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-7.html">How I Built This Site</a> to help. </p>
<p>use <code>git pull origin main</code> to i guess get the github repo. <br>
use <code>make html</code> and <code>make serve</code> to update the repo i guess. <br>
use <code>pelican content -s publishconf.py</code> to create published version of the site <br>
use <code>git add .</code> <br>
use <code>git commit -m "add barriers-to-entry.md"</code> <br>
use <code>git push origin main</code> <br>
use <code>ghp-import output</code> to post contents of the output directory to gh-pages branch <br>
use <code>git push -f origin gh-pages</code> <br></p>
